# Getting Started with Gno

Welcome to the world of Gno! This repository is your gateway to effortlessly embark on your journey of writing your first Gnolang Realm.

## Suggested Discovery Plan

1. Check out the tutorial section of [Awesome Gno](https://github.com/gnolang/awesome-gno#tutorials) and explore the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@_gnoland/videos) for previous workshops and demos.
2. Learn to use the `gno` CLI to write and test your contracts (`gno test [PATH]`) without relying on a blockchain. It offers speed and convenience.
3. Master `gnokey` for account management and performing transactions.
4. Discover how to publish contracts on your local devnet.
5. Obtain faucet tokens and publish your contracts on https://staging.gno.land or another testnet.
6. Start building more complex dApps, utilizing realms (`/r/...`) and pure packages (`/p/...`) you create or those crafted by the community. Leverage the `Render()` function for smooth interactions.
7. Experiment with creating web frontends or new clients to engage with the chain and your contracts.

## Using Gitpod

Gitpod simplifies the setup by providing a `gnoland` node, a `gnoweb` server, and a pre-configured terminal with the `gno` CLI.
