# Building Social Apps on Gno

## Overview

Congratulations on completing the previous steps! Now, let's take on a more challenging task.

One of Gno's standout features is how it simplifies building social apps compared to other ecosystems. Social apps focus on managing more complex objects, involving various types, recursive pointers, and so on, instead of just arrays of balances like many DeFi apps.

Let's explore some existing apps as examples. If you attend a physical workshop, feel free to ask questions and discuss with the organizers.

## Resources

Here are some example apps to get you started:

_Organizers Note: We can make this exercice better by bootstrapping a series of .gno files, with a Render func and commands calling `gno test --update-golden-tests`._
